Even the idea of emphasis kindof fades away with stuff like 02:06:974 (1,2,3,4) - 02:08:925 (1,2,3,4) - etc lacking quite a bit of punch to convey the song. With this being a lot lower in difficulty, some of the jumps seem unnecessarily jarring within this section 01:59:047 (5,1) - 02:14:657 (5,1) - 02:15:633 (6,1) - . Also 02:02:584 (3,4,5,6) - yellow thick rhythms huh.\nThis problem persists in the build-up 02:29:413 - , where there\'s a lack of clear patterning idea to tie together and mainly comes down to "put 1/8 sliders"\nIt\'s hard to really mention positives for this block.\n\nThe final block 02:37:218 - is quite a bit better, but seems too simplified. It\'ll often undermap the drums 02:39:169 (1,2,3,4,5,6,7) - as a much simpler rhythm, the wubs tend to get a simple slider 02:38:681 (7,8) - 02:46:730 (4) -  which don\'t really contrast against the rest. While this does bring out stuff like 02:40:999 (8,1,2,1,2,1,2) - well, it\'s an unfortunate sacrifice. Stuff like 03:03:560 (1,2) - is extremely weak for the melody, it might as well not be there.\n\nThe first block 00:16:730 - suffers more from lack of patterning coherency, using a lot of different slidershapes and rarely showing signs of decent pattern-grouping. Sometimes there\'s a bit of symmetry which is cool, but constantly swapping around ideas for 00:16:730 (1,3) - , 00:24:535 (1,3) - , 00:44:047 (1,1) - , 00:32:340 (1,3) - without something to tie it all together makes the section really unclear even if gameplay is more or less consistent. \nThere\'s also a bit of an issue with the spacing progression when going into 00:33:316 (1,2) - 00:35:999 (4,5,1) - 00:39:169 (1,2) - ,  it\'s like only a couple jumps got pushed massively and the rest stays the same, creating a jarring contrast (especially against the already low spacing from sliders)\nThere\'s also 01:14:291 (1,2,1,2,1,2,1) - later which is rather overdone.\n\n01:19:169 - The middle block here is the best one to me, a lot of things get a clear visual identity and gameplay feels better managed than usual with less massive jumps to speak of. Especially going from mostly using curves to making the calm section mostly red anchors is pretty slick 01:34:779 - . This first bit 01:50:389 - really pops off as well, until it unfortunately transitions.\n\nHitsounding: done pretty okay, good use of the default sampleset with a fitting snare.','criteria': { 'id': 1,'name': 'Expertise','maxScore': 30 } },{ 'id': 90,'qualifierJudgingId': 23,'criteriaId': 2,'score': 5,'comment': 'As mentioned in expertise, this diff has 4 blocks in my eyes (not counting intro & outro cuz they have limited impact on it)\n1.

This doesn\'t manifest too badly luckily, the map still does a generally okay job of representing the song and being balanced. There\'s some stuff that stands out though. \n\n00:16:718 - 00:47:938 - This entire first section feels rather lacking of both structure and contrast in ways that aren\'t rhythmical. One of the main offenders is how 1/4 sliders are handled, often having similar spacing, screen-usage and the motions through them are more a result of copy-paste-rotate rather than something that is supposed to highlight the song. There\'s not much difference between 00:33:182 (1,2,3,4,5,6) - and 00:38:182 (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8) - for example. \nAnother issue is the slidershapes, 00:16:718 (1,2) - 00:20:621 (1,2) - 00:24:523 (1,2) - .. , there\'s always a different pair with the pairing itself not being clear, the lack of a recognizable idea makes it rather disconnected. \nThe rhythm does a great job though, the longer chains of circles and 1/1 gaps at the right times liven up something which would otherwise be super bland.\n\nWhen looking at other parts this improves luckily, with 01:03:548 - onwards bringing clear pattern grouping. What I do find questionable is having both 01:09:401 (1,2,3,1,2,3,4,5) - and 01:14:279 (1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4) - be fairly similar patterns despite having vastly different purposes. There\'s also 01:26:962 (1,2,3,1) - ,  having the slider-heads so close really cuts out the motion and puts way more emphasis on the last note. This is more of a preface for what goes down later though I guess.\n\nWhat goes down is 01:50:377 - ,  interesting ideas but some mistake that make it way less than ideal. First issue is all the filler circles that very clearly disconnect from any melody, just so the percussion can be focused instead. Forcibly continuous rhythm makes this really stale. Arranges don\'t always work well either, with 01:51:352 (1,2,3,4,5) - being able to use a change on the melody 01:51:962 (4,5) - , 02:00:133 (1,2) - sliders being cut short and lacking their representing motion as result, 02:09:279 (2,1,2,3,4,5,6,1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4) - being too centered to where it draws away attention from 02:11:840 (1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5) -, and 02:19:645 (1,2,3,4,5,1,2) - feeling like a lack of change despite the song changing. To give some credit, great job on progressing out of 01:39:645 - .\n\nSo overall, while the ideas are displayed well, they\'re often not used well, which is a main detractor for this entry doing well.\n\nhitsounding: good samples.

This dulls the patterning idea quite a bit and makes it grow disconnected from the song as it goes on.

The build-ups themselves are quite something lol, but the work.\n\nSo in general this could be a solid entry if it randomly shoot out of line with its intensity, quite a drawback imo.\n\nHitsounds: Decent mixing of defaults and a custom kick and snare.

Angle emphasis gets also super inconsistent on these patterns, especially later on with 02:07:328 (3,1,2,3,4) - 02:15:133 (3,1,2,3,4) - . And 00:41:474 (3,1,2,3,4) - is kinda just .. in relation to all that.\n\nSliders often don\'t work with each other as progressions, 00:26:474 (1,2,3,1,1) - like these are all nice shapes but there\'s no sense of phrasing here in the slightest. Same for 01:07:450 (1,2,3,4,5,6,7) - , the progression in node-usage is really ineffective and kinda just looks random instead. There can also be inconsistencies within sections, like how the grouping here 00:28:426 (1,1) - vastly differs from anything before it.\n\nPatterns like 01:10:621 (2,3,1,2,3,4) - really don\'t fit in the map in general, as most of it uses small geometric shapes or linear patterns. I\'m especially not very fond of these since the jump pattern starts before the actual drum transition kicks in, creating a feel that\'s more disconnected than anything.\n\nOverall the map also tries to utilize visual distance but doesn\'t manage to get it down well, there\'s plenty of instances like 01:17:084 (4,5,6) - 00:27:938 (2,1) - that could easily be fixed if not for trying to force stacking. Then there\'s stuff like 01:50:865 (1,2,3,1,2) - where circle spacing kinda just has to obey how the sliders are placed rather than working together.\n\nThe map does do a decent job at keeping slider-shapes for their own specific-usecases, and patterns like 02:11:840 (1,2,1,2,1,2) - 01:29:889 (4,5,6,7) -  that travel across the screen add a nice contrast for the entire phrase. \n\nSummarized, there\'s a lot of forced habits, small errors and lack of ideas that combine into a general picture of not really being up to par. It somewhat works, but I can\'t say there\'s much Expertise present.\n\nHitsounding: Not sure what you were intending with just claps and finishes but it doesn\'t amount to much; generally not suited to the song.','criteria': { 'id': 1,'name': 'Expertise','maxScore': 30 } },{ 'id': 94,'qualifierJudgingId': 24,'criteriaId': 2,'score': 15,'comment': 'Well, the parts are fairly consistent so that\'s a plus, there are still small hickups though like 02:37:694 (1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4) -  vs 02:53:304 (1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,1) - , some of the constantly changing patterns mentioned in Expertise, 01:07:450 (1,2,3,4,5,6,7) - vs  01:23:060 (1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4) - pretty different ideas here, 01:55:255 (1,1) - vs 02:10:865 (1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4) - , etc.\nHow this section 00:32:328 - progresses from  the previous one is also kinda ? the entire spacing and patterning idea gets thrown out of the window for a new one.\nIt\'s also kinda amusing how something in the calm section 01:41:596 (1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3) - becomes more intense than like 00:37:206 (1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,1) - .\n\nThe general impression of sections tends to be cohesive, but lack of expertise kinda has its diminishing returns here as well.
