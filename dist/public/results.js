Even the idea of emphasis kindof fades away with stuff like 02:06:974 (1,2,3,4) - 02:08:925 (1,2,3,4) - etc lacking quite a bit of punch to convey the song. With this being a lot lower in difficulty, some of the jumps seem unnecessarily jarring within this section 01:59:047 (5,1) - 02:14:657 (5,1) - 02:15:633 (6,1) - . Also 02:02:584 (3,4,5,6) - yellow thick rhythms huh.\nThis problem persists in the build-up 02:29:413 - , where there's a lack of clear patterning idea to tie together and mainly comes down to \"put 1/8 sliders\"\nIt's hard to really mention positives for this block.\n\nThe final block 02:37:218 - is quite a bit better, but seems too simplified. It'll often undermap the drums 02:39:169 (1,2,3,4,5,6,7) - as a much simpler rhythm, the wubs tend to get a simple slider 02:38:681 (7,8) - 02:46:730 (4) -  which don't really contrast against the rest. While this does bring out stuff like 02:40:999 (8,1,2,1,2,1,2) - well, it's an unfortunate sacrifice. Stuff like 03:03:560 (1,2) - is extremely weak for the melody, it might as well not be there.\n\nThe first block 00:16:730 - suffers more from lack of patterning coherency, using a lot of different slidershapes and rarely showing signs of decent pattern-grouping. Sometimes there's a bit of symmetry which is cool, but constantly swapping around ideas for 00:16:730 (1,3) - , 00:24:535 (1,3) - , 00:44:047 (1,1) - , 00:32:340 (1,3) - without something to tie it all together makes the section really unclear even if gameplay is more or less consistent. \nThere's also a bit of an issue with the spacing progression when going into 00:33:316 (1,2) - 00:35:999 (4,5,1) - 00:39:169 (1,2) - ,  it's like only a couple jumps got pushed massively and the rest stays the same, creating a jarring contrast (especially against the already low spacing from sliders)\nThere's also 01:14:291 (1,2,1,2,1,2,1) - later which is rather overdone.\n\n01:19:169 - The middle block here is the best one to me, a lot of things get a clear visual identity and gameplay feels better managed than usual with less massive jumps to speak of.

There's a clear distinction between patterning, spacing doesn't randomly shove across the board and the screen is well used thanks to the linear patterns.\n\nIt does use the linear patterns a bit too much though, sometimes it's like 02:59:645 (1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1) - this is a linear pattern even though the instrumentation is so different than usual.\n\nIt also could use some breaks in intensity at times, in cases like 00:19:645 (2,3,4) - or 00:22:572 (1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,5,6) - the song slows down pretty noticeable but the map keeps on hammering on with its difficulty.\n\n02:33:304 (1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4) - also this is hardly a build-up lol\n\nOverall kinda fluctuates but can hold its ground decently well.\n\nHitsounds: lots of pew pews and wubs, but they work out rather well.

There's some stuff that stands out though. \n\n00:16:718 - 00:47:938 - This entire first section feels rather lacking of both structure and contrast in ways that aren't rhythmical. One of the main offenders is how 1/4 sliders are handled, often having similar spacing, screen-usage and the motions through them are more a result of copy-paste-rotate rather than something that is supposed to highlight the song. There's not much difference between 00:33:182 (1,2,3,4,5,6) - and 00:38:182 (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8) - for example. \nAnother issue is the slidershapes, 00:16:718 (1,2) - 00:20:621 (1,2) - 00:24:523 (1,2) - .. , there's always a different pair with the pairing itself not being clear, the lack of a recognizable idea makes it rather disconnected. \nThe rhythm does a great job though, the longer chains of circles and 1/1 gaps at the right times liven up something which would otherwise be super bland.\n\nWhen looking at other parts this improves luckily, with 01:03:548 - onwards bringing clear pattern grouping. What I do find questionable is having both 01:09:401 (1,2,3,1,2,3,4,5) - and 01:14:279 (1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4) - be fairly similar patterns despite having vastly different purposes. There's also 01:26:962 (1,2,3,1) - ,  having the slider-heads so close really cuts out the motion and puts way more emphasis on the last note. This is more of a preface for what goes down later though I guess.\n\nWhat goes down is 01:50:377 - ,  interesting ideas but some mistake that make it way less than ideal. First issue is all the filler circles that very clearly disconnect from any melody, just so the percussion can be focused instead. Forcibly continuous rhythm makes this really stale.

This dulls the patterning idea quite a bit and makes it grow disconnected from the song as it goes on.

Looking mainly at stuff like 00:36:230 (1,2,1,2) - or 02:56:718 (1,2,1,2,1,2,1) - which feel rather low in screen usage compared to their counterparts or what I'd expect in context.\n\nThat said, it's not necessarily easy to identify when and where this can be an issue, because this same clumping together is used to great effect to emphasize patterns that follow it.

Like I can tell that patterns like 00:38:182 (1,2,3,4,1,2,3) - move around more than others to represent different instrumentation, but really it hardly stands out due to the bland rhythm and the hardly changing intensity.

Angle emphasis gets also super inconsistent on these patterns, especially later on with 02:07:328 (3,1,2,3,4) - 02:15:133 (3,1,2,3,4) - . And 00:41:474 (3,1,2,3,4) - is kinda just .. in relation to all that.\n\nSliders often don't work with each other as progressions, 00:26:474 (1,2,3,1,1) - like these are all nice shapes but there's no sense of phrasing here in the slightest. Same for 01:07:450 (1,2,3,4,5,6,7) - , the progression in node-usage is really ineffective and kinda just looks random instead. There can also be inconsistencies within sections, like how the grouping here 00:28:426 (1,1) - vastly differs from anything before it.\n\nPatterns like 01:10:621 (2,3,1,2,3,4) - really don't fit in the map in general, as most of it uses small geometric shapes or linear patterns. I'm especially not very fond of these since the jump pattern starts before the actual drum transition kicks in, creating a feel that's more disconnected than anything.\n\nOverall the map also tries to utilize visual distance but doesn't manage to get it down well, there's plenty of instances like 01:17:084 (4,5,6) - 00:27:938 (2,1) - that could easily be fixed if not for trying to force stacking. Then there's stuff like 01:50:865 (1,2,3,1,2) - where circle spacing kinda just has to obey how the sliders are placed rather than working together.\n\nThe map does do a decent job at keeping slider-shapes for their own specific-usecases, and patterns like 02:11:840 (1,2,1,2,1,2) - 01:29:889 (4,5,6,7) -  that travel across the screen add a nice contrast for the entire phrase. \n\nSummarized, there's a lot of forced habits, small errors and lack of ideas that combine into a general picture of not really being up to par.

of the usage of some different shape sliders and some geometrical sliders, the object placement in general is quite random and lack of internal connections, result in many "blindly stuffed patterns" which make the aesthetic looks messy. a good way to fix this is to try to let the slider shapes "make sense", that means manually create consistent internal connections between various slider shapes (and try to avoid simple partial parallel/huge blanket techniques), like use multiple sliders to compose a decent shape and arrange their orders to create the best flow possible (such a little bit high-end techniques etc etc). it requires many practice so mappers involved in this diff still have many things to do if they want to make decent "tech" style maps\n\nrhythm side, many 1/8s have been omitted (00:36:718 (1) - etc, in transition parts) which is not a wise choice imo, since they make the transition part sexier and there\'re absolutely ways to map them without ruining the flow if this is your concern (like even use the simplest 1/8 sliders here would be better rhythm wise). the omits on electrical sounds 00:47:084 (6,7,1) - is also pretty questionable, at least if you want to use red node vibes for these sounds make them consistent, instead of omitting the sound on 00:47:328 - and 00:47:389 - this means you can either create two stars or use 1/8 slider spams instead of

Celeste is an entry I'd call comfortably within the realms of expected; solid but only is so because it keeps things simple. Mabel on the other hand opts to utilize high cs and heavy circle usage to create something different, but pays the price in execution.\n\nI honestly don't have a whole lot to say about Celeste. How it balances circles and sliders is satisfying to play through, the rhythm works well but can't help but wish for something more. Decent variety and usage of slidershapes and pattern techniques to vary things up, but those things don't come as a surprise - or even a skill when comparing to qualifiers. The most standout feature feels like the 1/6 bursts tbh. There's 00:47:476 (1,2) - which is rather spaced for being extended this far. \nBut yeah overall just like .. nothing that really jumps out to be, but also nothing that I can take issue with.\n\nMabel is a different story however. It starts of quite solidly with its small circle usage, with 00:27:210 - being very clear with tying its patterns to the song's different melodies while still keeping slider relevant. Though in later sections it kinda devolves into \"spam circles because that's the concept\", 00:41:076 (5,6,7) - 00:41:876 (2,3,4) - are the same 3 note patterns as in the previous section 00:29:343 (1,2,3) - , but the middle note is mapped to nothing (melodically), leaving a rather empty feeling. Same for 00:43:610 (1,2,3,4,5) - building into 00:44:943 (1,2,3,4,5,6) - , the map contradicts itself on the spot. Same 01:08:010 (1,2,3,4) - , taking away attention from surrounding melodies. 01:34:810 (1,2,3,4) - poor instrument mixing. Etc etc.\nI have to admit that 00:59:210 (1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2) - is really nutty in this setup.\nSo, while a unique idea, it really comes across as if only the first mapper knew how to handle it elegantly and then everyone else who followed kinda butchered it in accordance with the song. \n\nThe questions remains who I'd like to step up their game in the next round. For me that'd be Celeste, since they've shown that they have a solid baseline, can collab competently, but should aim to expand more on their ideas and creativity in the next round (you're not gonna beat some of these other teams with straightforward mapping). Expecting of Mabel to improve their understanding of mapping on a more fundamental level might be a bit much for one round, and this map is a clear display of not being able to coordinate well when the mapping gets more complex.

With fairly toned down SV choices and focus on the percussion they manage to fit the \"calm but eerie\" vibe quite well. I really like patterning like 00:24:762 (1,1,1,1,2,1,2) - because of that. Their stacked 1/4s and patterns like 00:52:052 (1,2,1,2,1,2) - 01:09:665 (1,1,1,1) - , \t01:03:471 (1) - 01:24:375 (1,2,3,1,2,3) - stand out quite a bit while still accompanying those ideas.\nVery very nice hitsounding as well.\nWhat I don't like about Sable is that some sections space their objects too close to sliderends, and also use rather cheesable sliders. As result a lot of the seemingly intended emphasis gets evened out and the map begins to lack contrast. eg. 01:22:439 (1,2,1,2) - 01:54:568 (1,2,1,2) - 01:56:891 (1,2,3) - etc .. for sv changes feeling weaker than they should and eg. 01:35:987 (1,2,1,2) - 01:55:729 (2,1,2) - 02:19:342 (1) - .\nCohesion also feels a bit lacking in that sense, most sections seem to change their idea of how sliders should be mapped in regards to play, which reduces the representativeness of the map overall, especially since it does feel like the mappers are trying to stick close in style. Especially not seeing big impacts like 01:30:568 (1,2,1) - return but rather become cheesable 01:55:729 (2,1,2) - and having the contrast after 01:57:665 (1) - seems rather backwards.\n02:35:600 (1,1,1) - 02:37:149 (1,2) - is really cool btw, but also has this \"but why here in particular\" feel on it.\n\nTimmy's good side is how it alternates between gameplay elements and motions really frequently, you'll often go from a big slider into spaced 1/4 or into something more rhythmical feeling etc. eg. 00:24:762 (1) - into 00:26:310 (1,1,1) - or 00:28:633 (1,2,1,1,1,2,3) - into 00:30:310 (1,2) - 00:30:955 (1) - are both good examples at this constant switching. What's also great is that this remains through the map pretty consistently, all participants execute it quite well.\nI'm not a huge fan of the pacing in 00:49:536 - , the section is by far the slowest in the song, but still has a ton of stuff going on, so it falls out of place.\nCohesion does lack a bit here as well, jumping from the heavy big wubslider usage in 01:14:310 - to use of a lot more simple and slower sliders in 01:39:084 - feels a bit off, same for switching to mainly circular type sliders in 02:03:858 - . In this case it comes across a bit more as individual expression to counteract the song's potential repetitiveness, I guess.\n\nAs for the winner, the mappers behind Timmy show to be more experienced with the genre and also are better at expressing their (individual) ideas, while the group behind Sable is less so and encounters some pitfalls imo.

Both entries are pretty damn solid, even if they have vastly different directions. So, I'll just keep it to why I prefer one over the other here.\n\nThe winner for me personally is Isabelle, it does a great job at using cs5 to create a map that really feels dynamic to play through. I adore progressions like 01:05:610 - to 01:13:610 - , where even with the slightest hint of increased intensity you'll be flowing across the screen along with it. Other sections do well at using this same idea, like the kiai 01:42:343 - where the playfield usage jumps out the most and is combined greatly with lower sv 01:45:610 (1,2,3) - 01:50:410 (1,2,3) - to offer strong feeling pauses. Putting overlapping circle patterns like in 00:27:343 - against that is also great, since they have the same linearity but are a lot more chill to play. \n\nWrinkle draws the short end of the straw for me. While it also has a smaller circle size, it feels like it's only there to give more space to work with for patterning. While I'm not particularly against that, with no accompanying design choices it does lose in that aspect. It does have a lot more patterns that look more unique, but as gameplay elements they often don't give that same impression. The opposite even, in the overall picture they kinda cause some sections to blend together because how similarly they're designed visually.\nFinally, what throws me off most is patterns like 00:40:010 (1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1) - , these are like 225bpm extended slider and to be quite honest ass to play. The gap between these doesn't seem to have been considered compared to everything else, making them a weird spike compared to the rest of the map. Then at 01:42:410 (1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2) - it's supposed to be more intense, except it isn't. The aim requirements are a lot lower and lot less snappy due to how the sliders are paired. It's a bit of a downer when the climax of the song is super underwhelming.\n\nSo, yeah, I prefer Isabelle here because it does a lot better at creating a cohesive and interesting map for this cool song, while Redd doesn't quite hit the spot with its fancy-slider approach.",judgeId:638,matchId:4,submissionChosenId:32,createdAt:"2020-07-18T23:08:46.956Z",updatedAt:"2020-07-18T23:08:46.956Z",judge:{id:638,osuId:4945926,username:"yaspo",roleId:6,requestAccessId:null,mapperApplicationId:null,captainVoteId:null,createdAt:"2020-06-13T04:32:03.521Z",updatedAt:"2020-06-14T05:20:22.000Z",isBasicUser:!1,isElevatedUser:!1,isRestricted:!1,isContestant:!1,isCaptain:!1,isJudge:!0,isStaff:!1},submissionChosen:{id:32,originalPath:"VN/Vietnam - Round of 16.osz",anonymisedAs:"Isabelle",anonymisedPath:"Round of 16/Isabelle.osz",countryId:30,createdAt:"2020-07-10T00:01:45.857Z",updatedAt:"2020-07-13T20:24:01.000Z",country:{id:30,name:"Vietnam",code:"VN",wasConfirmed:!0}}},{id:14,comment:"+:\nboth -\ngood aesthetic idea execution and nice song representation\n\n-:\nisabelle - \n1/3 single tap parts (00:27:210 - 00:38:276 - )'s circle only pattern usage feels too repetitive comparing with redd diff which uses different rhythms and sliders to improve the variety; torted slider aesthetic becomes a little bit weird in cs5 and even worse, there're multiple obvious copy-pastes that is not very high effort (like 01:42:410 (1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3) - you can at least switch the slider shapes a bit to make them looks more decent, that is actually the mappers in isabelle diff did sometimes)\n\nconclusion:\nalthough both are decent diff song representation wise, redd is my choice this time because of the obvious adventage on aesthetic side",judgeId:384,matchId:4,submissionChosenId:33,createdAt:"2020-07-20T06:47:24.102Z",updatedAt:"2020-07-20T07:10:08.000Z",judge:{id:384,osuId:7777875,username:"Ryuusei Aika",roleId:6,requestAccessId:null,mapperApplicationId:null,captainVoteId:null,createdAt:"2020-05-03T21:37:18.133Z",updatedAt:"2020-06-14T05:20:14.000Z",isBasicUser:!1,isElevatedUser:!1,isRestricted:!1,isContestant:!1,isCaptain:!1,isJudge:!0,isStaff:!1},submissionChosen:{id:33,originalPath:"CA/Canada - Round of 16.osz",anonymisedAs:"Redd",anonymisedPath:"Round of 16/Redd.osz",countryId:14,createdAt:"2020-07-10T09:58:02.118Z",updatedAt:"2020-07-13T20:13:42.000Z",country:{id:14,name:"Canada",code:"CA",wasConfirmed:!0}}},{id:22,comment:"First of all, i would like to make something very clear for both teams: At least to *me*, this was the hardest match to judge, because I believe both maps are reaaaallly good.

Isabelle on the other hand, seemed to save it for for very specific parts, and that's what made me vote for Redd.

Rhythmically both of them are nicely going along with the song, but apart from that they both shine at different aspects. Redd has a really coherent aesthetic style and makes use of interesting slidershapes. Their quirkyness fits quite well to the song's mood due to how the instruments are played here. The ending sliderart is beautiful. Sadly sometimes they aren't used as well as they could to enhance movement, as it feels like sliders without movement are overused, which can make the gameplay feel less engaging sometimes. Other parts of the map could use improvement in song expression through gameplay too, for example 00:40:010 - these patterns: the sliders might show the descend in pitch and intensity, but the gameplay doesn't due to sliderheads being equally spaced throughout the whole pattern. Isabelle has a few parts with underwhelming movement too, for example patterns like 00:46:410 -, but overall much less than Redd. In this entry, the concept of using low spaced circle patterns throughout works super well with the song, due to high density but not overly high intensity of the music. Those patterns, while low spaced, are still super engaging to play and the use of fast sliders along with low spaced circle patterns is awesome.

There is a lot to say here so I'll keep it to the factors that mattered for the decision. Wilbur's mappers show that they are capable of making patterns that are structured, engaging to play and coherent throughout the map. The main problem here is relation to music - like in the solo, where the constant melody is mapped almost exclusively with 1/4-sliders, turning it into a jumpy tech map in that part which just doesn't go along with the music for me. The 1/3-section is really repetetively mapped and the SVs feel overdone, but Wisp doesn't even map this part so it's hard to decide which was the better choice.

Look at things like 00:13:382 (1,2,1,2) - emphasizing the doubles, 00:23:319 (1,2,3,4,5,1,1,2,3,4,5,6,1) - 00:36:121 (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,1) - transitions that stand out. It also puts a lot more meaningful effort towards emphasizing strong instrumentation. Compare this section 01:08:987 - in both maps, the difference for things like 01:14:146 (1,2,3,4,1) - is like night and day to me.\nWisp in contrast has generally low spacing, which makes it feel rather underwhelming and cramped, being more of a rather simple rhythm-focused map. Seems to be mainly due to forcibly maintainig visual distance, especially in areas like  Its transitions are also kinda meh, with things like 00:35:548 (2,3,4,5,6,1,2,3,1,2,3) - not standing out much from what surrounds it. \nIn terms of general map structure and execution both entries are pretty equal in my eyes, sometimes even opting for very similar ideas like in 00:36:885 - .\nThe one thing that I do like more in Wisp is its solo 02:17:777 - , fitting the alt style a lot better than Wilbur's 1/8 slider usage. Then again, having such a long chain of circles with tons of spacing changes is a bit of a diffspike when the map is relatively low spacing throughout.

Even if density is notably different (due to the 1/8 slider usage),  overall everything just feels fast all the time, with the exception that stronger parts of the song have bigger sliders with bigger SV, but peaks/patterns/angles all feel very similar.

While it makes a lot of sliders like 01:26:697 (1) - 01:51:472 (1) - etc really epic to follow, it also contributes to inconsistent-feeling play and some rather harsh elements. \nSliders like 01:14:310 (1) - are pesky, because very fast back and forth combined with high cs means you need that much more precision to stay within in the sliderball. Especially an issue for cases like 01:32:891 (1) - , where the node placement isn't consistent and you have to adapt to the effect mid-slider. They're also not used in consistent places, so you can't always anticipate for these sliders based on the song, compare 01:14:310 (1) - 01:20:504 (1) - vs 01:26:697 (1) - or 01:55:923 (1) - . They're definitely introduced early on 00:36:568 (2) - , but I also  think they could've been implemented a whole lot better. \nSpacing choices like 00:32:117 (2,1,2,1) - 00:43:923 (2,1,2,1) - 00:45:278 (1,2,3) - etc in the early section draw away tons of attention from the seemingly more important synths, which is also amplified by the smaller circle size, especially consider spacing remains lower otherwise.\nI do like these to map the wubs in concept 01:14:697 (1,2,3,4,1) - , but again it's like .. where/when do these get used? There's no real pattern to it and hat rolls are literally everywhere in the song. Also would be nice to avoid using this unique design for different instrumentation 01:16:633 (1,2,1) - .\nI also like the progressive slowing down of sliders by using both svs and slidershapes, 01:21:278 (1) - 01:21:858 (1) - 01:22:826 (1) - 01:24:375 (1) - 01:24:955 (1) - is really nice. \nThough, to be honest the further into the map you go the less it feels connected to the song, due to the general complexity mixed with kindof out there ideas, individual choices and more precise cs. That said I can definitely give credit for creating something in the direction of workable, not an easy thing to map on your own let alone collab.\n\nTom Nook, in comparison, has a lot simpler design choices which make it overall a bit less appealing. Mostly it lacks the bit of the edge and overarching design that Flick has.\nThat said it did grow quite a bit on me after going through a couple times. I mainly like how this entry manages to really capitalize on its slower parts by keeping it simple, so you get simple yet effective emphasis on intenser sounds and sections. I have to say I also quite like the spaced 1/6, 01:16:633 (1,2,3,1) - etc, it kinda sucks initially but really sits well in the map with how frequently 1/6 is used in general.\nThat said, the simpler design does get contradicted a bit by later sections trying to pad in some 'creative' things like eg. 02:10:826 (1) - , they're kinda dumb on a skin without sliderends and don't fit anywhere in the map visually. It's also kinda unfortunate to see cs4.5 used here but not \"used\", there's pretty much nothing about this map that changes based on precision, you could easily use cs4 or even cs3.5 if you wanted.\n\nWhile Tom Nook is quite nice and doesn't give me a ton to complain about, I do think Flick has a lot more potential to be something greater. This makes the choice quite difficult, as it's kinda like picking a balanced character vs a character that really only excells in one or two things. Personally, I do like it when more interesting choices get attempted and pulled off to some degree vs something mostly safe, since it really expands the possibilities.

Especially sections like 00:52:810 - struggle to really form contrast against the rest of the map. This cascades further down to the kiai, where the type of circle patterns has more or less begun to be a common thing which results in lesser impact, even with some of the added spacing.

With additive rhythm that doesn't feel out of place it can completely shift the mood to something a lot stronger than everything that came before it. The climax then really hits the spot being able to build out of its new ideas, which is quite nutty.

Rover is by no means a bad map, but where I'd mainly draw the difference between these two is the progression+contrast between phrases and hypermeasures, and general difficulty balance. \n\nFor Blathers, what makes it so great is it's strong usage of 2/3 gaps that act as pauses. This works out to be a great way to set up a theme early on in the intro. Having 00:05:238 (1,2,3,4,5,1) - 00:10:590 (2,3,4,5,6,7,1,2,3,4,5,6,7) - 00:17:914 (1,2,3,4,5,6,7) - are a great kind of mini-build-up to indicate the next 4 measures coming in, progressing greatly into the actual build-up 00:23:829 (1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1) - .  \nMore important to me is stuff like 00:29:343 (1,2,3,1,2,3) - and 00:35:743 (1,2,3,1,2,3) - , by using 2/3 gaps here you effectively draw a line between the first two and last 2 measures of each section. This allows 00:30:410 (1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,1,2) - to stand out with a stronger continuity and bring out the 1/6 sliders. While, 00:36:810 (1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,1,2) - has more gaps which makes it feel calmer in comparison. \nThe same idea continues throughout the map, with instances on a smaller scale too like how the full beat break 00:44:410 (3,1) - gives emphasis to 00:44:810 (1,2,3,1,1,2,3) - , 01:10:143 (1,2,1) - into 01:10:676 (2,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1) - , etc ..\nUsage of the 2/3 gaps then finally allows 01:29:610 - to increase pacing by just not having the gaps essentially (there's more to it but that in its own is really effective). \nOverall really manages to bring forward an idea as a whole, in a way that leverages the song really well - and rather creatively too. Especially liking how focused this diff works out to be without having to force it, thanks to good implementation of good ideas.\n\nRover really lacks this kind of element quite a bit. In the intro it really only has 00:06:083 (4) - and 00:12:703 (3,4,5) -  to indicate the end of one hypermeasure leading into another, which is quite minimal. Doesn't really improve from there on out the constant density in places like 00:33:743 (1,2,3,4,5,1,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,1) - or 01:05:476 (1,2,3,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,3,4,1,2,1,2,1,1,2,3,1) - ends up feeling like it's layered over the song rather than really suiting it much. There's also instances like 00:55:610 (4,1,2,1,2,3,4,5) - where the patterns might change a bit, but don't really progress in terms of intensity or gameplay elements. Etc.\nThere's also a  bit to be said in terms of cohesion, like 01:15:343 (1,1) - 01:16:943 (1) - separating the repeats from the circles rhythmically is interesting, but doesn't appear elsewhere so it kinda gets lost and becomes underwhelming. Same for these lower svs 01:36:410 (1) - 01:37:876 (1) -. 00:27:143 - 01:29:610 - comparing these 2 sections shows little change rhythmically and in terms of intensity, the different pattern & flow ideas are there but it doesn't do a great job at expressing the difference. \nThis one doesn't work as well in terms of the larger picture. Often feels like the mappers were too focused on isolated patterns and emphasis, rather than making their ideas build of each other.\n\nIn terms of difficulty balance, Blathers has a nice growing difficulty that never spikes too much, using the same type of angles and aim elements throughout. Rover is rather constant for the first half, and rather feels kinda centered around the spikes at 01:24:943 (1,1,1,2,3,1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4) - and 01:48:543 (2,3,4,5,1) - .

One good example for that, is at 01:32:943 (1,2,3,4,1,2,3,1,2,3,4) - where patterns are clearly creating emphasis on groups of 4 and 3, however, the song is not emphasizing those notes like that.

Let's look at a couple different sections\n-- 01:07:131 - is full of different wub sounds, which all get unique sliders, but when looking at the bigger whole of this part there's only one set of unique sliders which is 01:08:352 (1) - etc. The rest of the sliders is designed in a way that you don't really need to follow them ever, for example 01:11:230 (2,1,2,1,2) - 01:15:155 (1) - 01:22:393 (2) - 01:32:771 (2,1) - 01:34:689 (1) - .. Adding to that, is that the snares like 01:07:480 (4,1) -  01:10:271 (1,1) - 01:18:643 (4,1) - 01:21:434 (1,1) - 01:24:224 (1,1) - add visual interest for something that ultimately isn't deemed interesting gameplay-wise.\nCombined, when you get to stuff like 01:28:207 (1,1,1) - which is an obvious transition, it doesn't really provide much impact at all. Not visually nor gameplay-wise.\nAs result playing through this feels generally inconsistent with itself and the song, leaving at best a visual representation of the rhythms that were chosen. There's a couple of redeeming qualities like the pace picking up really big here 01:29:457 (1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,1) - (sadly that dissipates as quickly as it came though) and 01:35:038 (1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1) - is a cool way to use visuals effectively.\n-- the slow section after 01:40:968 - and 1/3 section have more or less the same issues, continued. Like 01:44:806 (1,1,1,1,2,1,2) - is cool but how does it represent something -new- ? The 1/3 section relies too heavily on sv changes alone to represent the wubs, so you get inconsistencies like 01:54:573 (1) - 01:57:015 (1) - 02:00:155 (1) - . All could pass as individual design choices but there's nothing that really ties it together\n-- Last section/thing I'd like to mention is 02:31:666 - , more in particular 02:31:666 (1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,1,1,1,2,1,2,1,2) - . While it's great that this is established as something notably unique in the map .. using the most simple patterns really seems contradictory here. Personally I find this really poor handling of something that's an obviously distinct theme in the song.\n\nOnly things I really ended up liking about this map where the intro and outro, which do a great job at conveying disonnance without straying far from the song. The rest feels like a step below in execution from what I'd expect for this stage.\n\nAnyways, as for nuudles:\n-- 01:07:131 - By using a lot more simple sliders in combination with more complex ones, they immediately get across a better impression of what the song is doing. Since their style is also a lot more open, it leaves sliders more likely to be played out and feel emphasized. I does an okay but not amazing job at that; plenty when relatively speaking.\n-- the slow section 01:40:968 - is very effective, introducing some new patterns and being more rhythmical - providing an effective separation to the previous section. This forms a great introduction for the 1/3 section, which is really cool in that uses a lot more circle rhythms. In combination with consistent slider-usage, this is overall very satisfying to play through.\n-- 02:31:666 - really makes a huge difference between the entries for me. Where awp kinda put down something boring, nuudles understands the song and really captures it. The constant but intuitive sv changes combined with changing the sliders when the drums change is a really sick way to pattern this section out, as it remains straining while keeping it relatively simple.\n\nAlso the hitsounding on this is kinda yolo lmao, genuinely had to laugh at 01:12:364 (1,1) - . Feels like the sliderarts contain some kind of story-element so I'm curious to hear what that actually is, would be a cool easter egg.\n\nBut yeah, overall nuudles is more expressive of the song, has more expressive gameplay elements, better structure and doesn't just rely on a style to get itself through this round. That's not to say that awp's stylistic approach is bad - it just doesn't have the fundamentals and execution to work at this level.",judgeId:638,matchId:11,submissionChosenId:55,createdAt:"2020-08-15T22:27:25.208Z",updatedAt:"2020-08-15T22:27:25.208Z",judge:{id:638,osuId:4945926,username:"yaspo",roleId:6,requestAccessId:null,mapperApplicationId:null,captainVoteId:null,createdAt:"2020-06-13T04:32:03.521Z",updatedAt:"2020-06-14T05:20:22.000Z",isBasicUser:!1,isElevatedUser:!1,isRestricted:!1,isContestant:!1,isCaptain:!1,isJudge:!0,isStaff:!1},submissionChosen:{id:55,originalPath:"AR/Argentina - Quarter finals.osz",anonymisedAs:"nuudles",anonymisedPath:"Quarter finals/nuudles.osz",countryId:49,createdAt:"2020-08-08T03:50:27.458Z",updatedAt:"2020-08-08T04:01:16.000Z",country:{id:49,name:"Argentina",code:"AR",wasConfirmed:!0}}},{id:56,comment:'I felt that both entries tried to express the overall atmosphere of the music through the slider shape.

[awp > nuddles]\n\n02:25:968 - 03:09:806 - in awp this part falls a little bit too hard comparing with previous parts: even there\'re still constantly sick sliders, there\'re a problem here - the sv for the dominant wub parts (like 02:31:550 - 02:36:434 - has way slower sv and this makes the last part seriously lacks visual impact comparing with previous two parts, the poor aesthetic execution for some sliders (long sliders like 02:26:317 (1) - 02:37:480 (1) - , their connection among neighboring objects are pretty weak because of the usage of simple ways like blankets and equal distances instead working on actual slider aesthetic; short sliders like 02:40:445 (1,2,3) - 02:42:364 (1,2,3) - , they\'re in too simple shape and slightly curved sliders don\'t paring with the patterns around well) and the frequent copy pastes (02:43:294 (1,2,3) - etc. but this is minor since nuddles diff also use some just less frequent and this is also a kind of style) more or less aggrevate such situation. \nnuudles diff instead keeps the high sv usage on such dominant wub parts + it actually trying to combine the aesthetic characteristics of two wub parts before by applying wubby sliders on simple geometry based patterns - since these sliders doesn\'t tort much, this actually works really well as a nice patch to the two parts before, very clever one. mappers included here are also trying to not use too much copy-pastes and make few variations (like 02:34:457 (2,1,2,1,2,1,1,2,1) - comparing with 02:31:899 (1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1) - ), which is also a nice try.

Intermezzo's entry breaks the rule of mappable % ending the map at 74%, which not only is an objective issue but also quite dissapointing to skip the outro when so much more could've been done... I understand the decision, but it's still quite sad, of course most people won't like mapping silent parts, it's quite boring compared to the rest yeah, but this is a competition. I won't count this too majorly but it did lower noticeably my impression on this entry.\n\nIn terms of mapping alone, I consider Intermezzo more well executed on it's structure, the map has a clear visual appeal on it's patterns and also a very consistent flow throughout the entire map, not to mention how the contrast between different sections is also quite well done and hitsounding is ok, not an ahead of the curve hitsounding but a good one nonetheless. My \"complaint\" on this map (which is not a problem just an observation) besides the mapped %, is how it felt like this team could've been more audacious on different parts... Most notably at 02:26:317 - cause even though the map change noticeably to follow the song, it didn't really do anything that it hadn't previously introduced, so it felt like the map was focusing being functional more than trying to be unique and stand out.\n\nEcho on the other hand, also kept the map decently structured but seemed to focus on the experience and uniqueness. Creating this ''thriller'' theme that matches really well with the song was a really bold and a nice choice. Turning the long quiet parts of the song into something interesting with the slidertick hitsounds and different sounds/noises that were being added to make them feel more interesting and less boring was a really great idea, the mapping also doesn't fall behind especially after 02:25:271 - where it had some really impressive patterns that are both very interesting visually but also flow incredibly well, creating a very unique experience. Hitsounding also staying on point with different samples that complement the song very well. I feel like some parts could be a bit more polished in terms of structure, which I believe Intermezzo performs way better at...

It was a great way to show their similarity while at the same time showing the progression and standing out from the rest.  it would be nice to have them a little more consistent in difficulty though as the ones later on like 02:44:282 (1,1,1,1,1) - are way easier than the ones at the start. \nOn the negative side of echo, i felt like the section at 01:43:061 (1) - was too intense compared to the rest of the chorus when it could have been used for a small break before going back to how intense the rest is, especially things like the jumps in the bursts at 01:43:061 (1,2,1,2,1) - and patterns like 01:48:294 (1,2,3,1) -. Last thing I wanted to mention about this diff is some of the patterns feeling a bit unfair/unfun like throwing in 03:02:771 (5) - for one time after 3 minutes with multiple fast reverses you have to follow or a pretty unclear slowdown in the slider at 04:00:155 (1) - .\n\nThen onto Intermezzo, the best part for me of this diff is how 01:51:782 (1) - was handled in its slidershapes which really made for a completely different feeling even though a lot of the rhythm density stayed pretty similar. I felt like some parts in the song had some lost potential though, an example of this would have been 01:15:591 (2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16) - where its just straight sliders with slight decreases in sv which isnt all that interesting movementwise as its just played a slow stream. The way the intro was handled in this diff was also less fitting to me than in echo as the distortions they had for the sliders fit the general atmosphere better than how clean the straight lines were here. Prefferably the ending sections would have also been mapped in this diff as leaving the entire ending open is kind of a waste when you could have used similar ideas from the start there too.\n\nIn the end I prefer echo over intermezzo as while both are good, i prefer the way echo shows the uniqueness of the song more, especially in the parts later on.",judgeId:642,matchId:12,submissionChosenId:53,createdAt:"2020-08-13T16:34:18.284Z",updatedAt:"2020-08-13T16:34:18.284Z",judge:{id:642,osuId:6122935,username:"Stack",roleId:6,requestAccessId:null,mapperApplicationId:null,captainVoteId:null,createdAt:"2020-06-14T11:24:52.444Z",updatedAt:"2020-08-10T20:16:23.000Z",isBasicUser:!1,isElevatedUser:!1,isRestricted:!1,isContestant:!1,isCaptain:!1,isJudge:!0,isStaff:!1},submissionChosen:{id:53,originalPath:"BR/Brazil - Quarter finals.osz",anonymisedAs:"Echo",anonymisedPath:"Quarter finals/Echo.osz",countryId:38,createdAt:"2020-08-08T02:21:59.613Z",updatedAt:"2020-08-08T04:02:30.000Z",country:{id:38,name:"Brazil",code:"BR",wasConfirmed:!0}}},{id:49,comment:"Expertise:\n[Intermezzo] not mapping the outro is kind of a wasted opportunity to do something interesting to me.

A bad first sign for a map in this contest. \n01:07:131 - is where it starts to feel inted to me. While cs4.5 is used in this map, the mappers keep using the same type of style you'd usually use. With more condensed patterning this results in the entire section feeling like a slow crawl of hold sliders and a couple jumps. Like especially things like 01:18:294 (1,2,3) - 01:19:515 (1) - 01:23:003 (1,1,1,1) - 01:25:140 (1) - 01:07:131 (1) - 01:08:352 (1) - .. etc just kill any movement you can build up to use or exploit the circle size. Gameplay is very stale and song representation simply follows along. \nIt's kinda disappointing that the slow section 01:40:620 - has about the same level of interest as the first part too, same complexity visually and same gameplay elements (even 1/4 jumps added). \nThe 1/3 section 01:52:829 - is just poorly handled, seems to be focused on small spacing to coordinate around but then 01:55:155 (2,3) - bam, 01:59:341 (2,1) - bam, random jumps that don't really emphasize anything. The forced continuous rhythm in this section also hurts it, as there's plenty of pauses in the song without any of it feeling like it's expressed. Difference in wub sounds is also not apparent, 01:59:806 (1,3) - for example, etc ..\nThe kiai 02:25:271 - has some interesting bits too it, but this too falls flat. Mainly because it starts of with some ideas that are already wack for the cs, especially 02:34:515 (1,1,1,1,1) - . But then it also breaks those ideas completely with patterns like 02:42:887 (1,1,1,1,1) - 02:44:282 (1,1,1,1,1) - 02:45:678 (1,1,1,1,1) - 02:54:050 (1,1,1,1,1) - 02:55:445 (1,1,1,1,1) - 02:56:841 (1,1,1,1,1) - . Like cohesion was a category since qualifiers and it's definitely not present here, map just disconnnects from itself.\nThe drop that spills the bucket is these R 03:06:085 (1) - U 03:07:480 (1) - N 03:08:875 (1) - sliders. Creative? Sure. A good idea at this speed and circle size, without having an effective introduction? Not really. \n\nCredits to the hitsounding, there's some cool potential for storytelling here by turning the song in some kind of horrormovie. Sadly with the quality of the map it ends up as a more superficial seeming way to get points from the judges.\n\nIntermezzo is really solid in comparison, I really like ideas like 00:44:806 (1,1,1) - into 00:53:178 (1) - where setting up one theme and then shattering it is super effective. A lot better than the rundown \"the sliders were distorted with olibomby's tumor generator so now they aren't\".

It's clear there has been a big attention to detail here, and it works super well, even though the gameplay itself in this section is not that interesting (mostly long slider art). The hitsounding continues to be great in the rest of the map, but here it stands out the most I think.\n01:07:131 - to 01:48:992 - has some cool stuff like 01:15:503 (1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8) - (i love how the hitsounding makes these wrong snaps work anyway), 01:37:960 (1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1) - (the simplicity of it, but yet it works so well on representing the sounds) but is overall a simple, clean wub section. I feel like it could've been more intense in movements, to prepare the player for the kiai which goes completely nuts on that.\n01:48:992 - to 02:14:108 - This part feels a bit more messy and less focused than the previous part, as the patterns start having less visual connections, which is a bit incoherent with the rest of the entry. Movement is also not handled the best it could be here, with most of the spacings being quite low but fast sliders also having very non-linear shapes like 02:10:271 (1) - most of the time, there is a lot happening on screen but not so much in gameplay which can feel rather underwhelming or disconnected.\n02:14:108 - to 02:25:271 - This section works decently as a transition and has some simple and neat patterning ideas. I like how intensity is slightly building down throughout this part, be it intentional or not, as it makes the start of the kiai feel a bit more epic than it would otherwise.\n02:25:271 - to 03:10:620 - Now this is the really creative part. There are some very unique ideas and patterns in this section, of which sadly some don't translate to gameplay very well, but for sure they make this entry stand out a lot. I like the consistent use of scaled up geometric shapes like 02:26:317 (1,2,3,4) -, 02:59:806 (1,2,1,1) - etc. Then there's these patterns.. 02:31:724 (1,1,1,1,1) - 02:33:120 (1,1,1,1,1) - 02:34:515 (1,1,1,1,1) - etc, they all look super neat. Some of them have a back-and-forth movement to them which works quite well as a translation to gameplay, however some others don't, like 02:33:120 (1,1,1,1,1) - where it's very hard to tell what is the intended movement here (as following the sliders accurately is not intuitive but staying in one place is neither). Also 02:31:724 (1,1,1,1,1) - is very hard to sightread - it would've been better to use a different pattern to introduce the concept, and keep ones like this for later on in the section. Later on, some of those patterns feel quite underwhelming in movement and structure compared to earlier ones, for example 02:44:282 (1,1,1,1,1,1) - or 02:55:445 (1,1,1,1,1) -. Finally you have these letters 03:05:213 (1,1,1,1,1) - etc, which work quite well as an element of the storytelling and also look really cool, but their implied movement feels quite sloppy and times, and provides a huge difficulty spike in the context of this map, as those fast sliders with quite unusual angles and spacings between them are extremely hard to aim.\n03:10:620 - to 04:05:736 - is one minute of mostly sliderart. The hitsounding is not as engaging as in the intro in my opinion, which makes this section quite underwhelming apart from the glitchy parts (but Intermezzo didn't map this part so I'm not gonna consider this section as a negative for my decision).\n\nIntermezzo:\n00:22:480 - to 01:07:131 - Basically all entries on this song went for mostly sliderart in this section (obviously the song doesn't call for much else), but I think this map does this quite well. Most of the sliderarts are fast and quite engaging to play, and the shapes are used quite well to provide different types of cursor movements (00:36:434 - smooth curvy vs. 00:44:806 - linear sharp) to represent the song, instead of just using aesthetics for that. 00:53:178 (1) - is the only place in the map that feels not interesting for gameplay.\n01:07:131 - to 01:51:782 - is mostly meta \"tech\" mapping, executed pretty much flawlessly, but not very unique. Most of the rhythms and movements here are quite straightforward, with most active clicks being on white and red ticks, and single sounds mostly being represented through different slidershapes and slider velocities. 01:37:945 (1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2) - I like this pattern quite a bit because of its simplicity and effective use of slider velocity (it's actually surprisingly similar to the same pattern in Echo), i also appreciate little gimmicks like 01:46:899 (3,4,1,2,1) -.\n01:51:782 - to 03:10:620 - Is where the map becomes amazing. Rhythm becomes a lot more interesting, as the main snap switches from 1/4 to 1/6 but the 1/6 snaps are represented through various combinations of active and passive rhythm, instead of relying mostly on short sliders to fill it up. The slider velocity changes become just a bit less frequent and the focus switches more towards using specific slidershapes to create faster or slower movements. Each nudge in the longer shapes seems to have a purpose for gameplay, instead of just using long aesthetic-focused sliders with intent to aim the head and tail, which is really cool. I like the usage of patterns like 02:32:160 (1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,4,5,1,2) -, the strong movement contrast here provides nice emphasis on the drums and also is very different from all other patterns in the map, which makes these special sounds stand out nicely.\n03:10:620 - Sadly the outro isn't mapped, which is my biggest criticism of the map. While I understand the decision from a mapper's perspective, since the outro would be quite boring to map (and also most likely boring for gameplay, due to sliderart spam) the map ends before 80% now and is unrankable in its current state.\n\nOverall, I think Echo has awesome hitsounding and the most creative ideas in the kiais, but they aren't executed consistently well, and some other parts of the map fall flat. Intermezzo has a better intro, and really great wub sections that last for a majority of the map. Even without the outro being mapped, I slightly prefer Intermezzo.",judgeId:641,matchId:12,submissionChosenId:52,createdAt:"2020-08-16T18:06:35.892Z",updatedAt:"2020-08-16T18:06:35.892Z",judge:{id:641,osuId:2202645,username:"Myxo",roleId:6,requestAccessId:null,mapperApplicationId:null,captainVoteId:null,createdAt:"2020-06-14T05:27:09.972Z",updatedAt:"2020-06-14T05:27:22.000Z",isBasicUser:!1,isElevatedUser:!1,isRestricted:!1,isContestant:!1,isCaptain:!1,isJudge:!0,isStaff:!1},submissionChosen:{id:52,originalPath:"VN/Vietnam - Quarter finals.osz",anonymisedAs:"Intermezzo",anonymisedPath:"Quarter finals/Intermezzo.osz",countryId:30,createdAt:"2020-08-08T01:59:05.480Z",updatedAt:"2020-08-08T04:02:01.000Z",country:{id:30,name:"Vietnam",code:"VN",wasConfirmed:!0}}}]},{id:13,information:null,roundId:3,teamAId:16,teamBId:13,createdAt:"2020-05-29T10:50:56.005Z",updatedAt:"2020-07-23T17:10:12.000Z",teamA:{id:16,name:"United Kingdom",code:"GB",wasConfirmed:!0},teamB:{id:13,name:"Australia",code:"AU",wasConfirmed:!0},submissions:[{id:48,originalPath:"AU/Australia - Quarter finals.osz",anonymisedAs:"Sinistro",anonymisedPath:"Quarter finals/Sinistro.osz",countryId:13,createdAt:"2020-08-07T18:39:17.308Z",updatedAt:"2020-08-08T04:04:07.000Z",country:{id:13,name:"Australia",code:"AU",wasConfirmed:!0}},{id:54,originalPath:"GB/United Kingdom - Quarter finals.osz",anonymisedAs:"Sarumaru",anonymisedPath:"Quarter finals/Sarumaru.osz",countryId:16,createdAt:"2020-08-08T03:44:09.215Z",updatedAt:"2020-08-08T04:04:54.000Z",country:{id:16,name:"United Kingdom",code:"GB",wasConfirmed:!0}}],eliminationJudging:[{id:45,comment:"I had a bit of trouble deciding between these two, both were extremely well done and they both seem to aim for similar aspects on the difficulty with the bigger emphasis on the 1/6 patterns and such.

While cs4.8 is pretty daring, especially when it ends up as a 7* map, it wasn't handled well.\nMy main concern lies in the constantly spaced nature of the map, especially the diffspikes. Like sure, stuff like 00:07:297 (2,3,4,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,1,2,3,1) - is introduced early on, but the rest of the map doesn't really live up to the amount of strain it brings. With most of the map otherwise focusing on slow sliders, anything but the circle jumps really quickly starts to become forgettably slow paced. There's also no real other distinct patterns in the map, adding to this kind of tunnel-vision on wacky circle patterns.

Some patterns throughout the map, while I generally appreciate the simplicity, could have used just a bit more attention to detail when it comes to song representation, for example 01:39:583 (1,1,1,2) - could represent the different pitches with more than just NCing. The map is very coherent stylistically, but the intensity is really questionable at times as, for example, patterns like 02:59:583 (1,2,3,4,1) - where both density and spacing are low, are used in intense parts of the song. 03:23:869 (1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3) - is an extreme difficulty spike that seems barely alternatable for most players, considering the speed and spacing of this pattern, it feels very out of place in this otherwise alt-friendly map (besides, it makes other intense parts feel more underwhelming because of their generally low 1/6-spacings).\n\nSarumaru feels a bit less stylistically coherent, especially on visuals where ways sliders are designed seem to vary significantly between mappers, in a way that doesn't necessarily go along with changes in the song. However, the gameplay is very coherent as similar kinds of flow and spacing ideas connect the map together as a whole.

Aside from that there was also the fact that there were some really hard spikes in the difficulty of certain parts, 01:15:869 (1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3) - while I certainly get using some cool intense patterns for parts of the song like this, I feel that it detracts from the intensity a lot of other patterns in the same section should have like 01:22:726 (1,2,3,4,1,1,1,1,1) - really doesn't have the same impact and feels rather weak.\nThe main thing RBRar3 has over yelle is the variety though, where yelle started to feel really samey at times because of the patterns not really varying that much, that same problem wasn't present here. Partially by the large amount of variety in sliders and variations in movement for similar parts of the song.\n\nOnto yelle then, the main strength of this diff for me was how well the diff fit the intensity of the song perfectly. Like I mentioned above, there were some spots where some of the patterns felt reused a bit too much like 00:19:583 (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,1) - was used a lot and some variations on it could have helped with this. The rhythm also felt more fitting as the lower density allowed for some layers to be shown off way more than others which helped highlight the more unique sounds the song had like at 03:44:154 (1) - where in RBRat3 it didn't stand out as much.\n\nOverall I prefer yelle over RBRat because of how the intensity fits so perfectly and the way it showcases the rhythms the song has better.",judgeId:642,matchId:19,submissionChosenId:51,createdAt:"2020-08-11T17:00:55.856Z",updatedAt:"2020-08-11T17:00:55.856Z",judge:{id:642,osuId:6122935,username:"Stack",roleId:6,requestAccessId:null,mapperApplicationId:null,captainVoteId:null,createdAt:"2020-06-14T11:24:52.444Z",updatedAt:"2020-08-10T20:16:23.000Z",isBasicUser:!1,isElevatedUser:!1,isRestricted:!1,isContestant:!1,isCaptain:!1,isJudge:!0,isStaff:!1},submissionChosen:{id:51,originalPath:"KR/South Korea - Quarter finals.osz",anonymisedAs:"yelle",anonymisedPath:"Quarter finals/yelle.osz",countryId:12,createdAt:"2020-08-08T00:52:12.777Z",updatedAt:"2020-08-08T04:06:15.000Z",country:{id:12,name:"South Korea",code:"KR",wasConfirmed:!0}}},{id:44,comment:"I'm not sure if the structural choice from RBRat3 ended up hitting me a bit too negatively but when playing and looking the map i feel like the straight structure felt way too forced in several moments making some wonky flows... the 1/6 usage of streams also were realy weird at several moments creating very spiked moments in the song too suddenly...

Although [yelle] has shown good expression in detailed aspects, [RBRat3] had a strong contrast overall to clearly show the music with its own originality.\n\nThe advantage of the structure design of [RBRat3] was its clarity. The clear difference of combo color haxing and slider velocity between different sections created a major contrast to indicate which part of the song the map was expressing. Also the overall linear formed sliders created originality along the cyberpunk BG.\n\nThe strength of [yelle] was with the detailed expression within the section. Long sliders at 01:06:440 (1) - appeared with a different shape/color, and the idea was used again at a similar part of the song in 02:40:154 (1) - with a lower intensity to show the similarity of the song. One of the cons was the vagueness of delivering the structural design of the map. The main feature of the map didn't felt to vary a lot between sections, or even if they did, it didn't felt clear enough mainly because of the blue-pink two-toned combo colors being used.\n\nI'll have to mention the hitsoundings of both entries too, as it seems there was some attempt. Interesting ones from [RBRat3] were 00:39:297 - the oriental drums, and 01:15:869 - Billy. Just hearing them felt like an okay addition to the song, but I couldn't really feel a strong relationship between the hitsounding and the map. For example, 00:39:297 (1,3) - vs. 00:41:583 (2,1) - are sharing the same hitsounding but are using a different pattern. That made me feel the pattern designer and the hitsound designer were having a different interpretation of the song, instead of strengthening one side. Same opinion with the overall normal-whistles.\n\nHitsound of [yelle] had an even more oriental feeling based on the hitnormal sample, and the \"yo-\" sound at 00:08:154 made it stronger. Creating an overall mood of the map with hitsounds was good, however one of the biggest issues was the hitsound design between sections being highly identical.

It's very coherent stylistically, with ideas being shared between all the mappers, even down to slidershapes and general pattern design. I like the climax with this section 03:25:869 -, which reuses ideas from throughout the map but with more intensity and while adding a certain edge to it (for example using edgier slider designs 03:35:012 (1,2,1) - etc). The hitsounding feels a bit lacking for the map's dense rhythm, and the custom hitnormal feels quite agressive to be used on every sound - using default soft-hitnormal on weaker sounds like slider tails would have worked wonders here.\n\nRBRat3 on the other hand takes much more risks with a higher difficulty, and a quite limiting concept making the whole patterning based around specific geometric shapes, that could easily get repetetive - but it is quite successful with it. I love how the usage of polygon shaped sliders evolves over the course of this map, from basic use at the start like 00:36:726 (1) - to more complex interactions with other objects like 01:34:154 (1,2,3,1) - and sliders like 01:37:869 (3) - for a distorted effect. Later on, patterns like 03:32:726 (1,2,3) - just feel really clever in their use of geometry, especially because they also play out quite intuitively. It all climaxes in the solo at 03:44:154 - where the most complex patterns are used, for example 03:55:012 (1,2,3,1,2) - feels really satisfying to play after all the introduction throughout the map. Having a progression like this is quite impressive, especially since this is a team effort.

This entry too skips all the triples in the second half of the chorus so lol.\n\nSo idk, solid but not super impressive entry vs contest bait with somewhat interest ideas ? \n\nBeing in semis right now and going into finals I'd say the not-impressive entry in this case comes across as skillcapped, and I'd rather see the silly patterns amuse be again with maybe something to better tie the whole thing together and keep up intensity.\nWINter wins and Fall falls for me.",judgeId:638,matchId:14,submissionChosenId:57,createdAt:"2020-09-12T21:43:10.187Z",updatedAt:"2020-09-12T21:43:10.187Z",judge:{id:638,osuId:4945926,username:"yaspo",roleId:6,requestAccessId:null,mapperApplicationId:null,captainVoteId:null,createdAt:"2020-06-13T04:32:03.521Z",updatedAt:"2020-06-14T05:20:22.000Z",isBasicUser:!1,isElevatedUser:!1,isRestricted:!1,isContestant:!1,isCaptain:!1,isJudge:!0,isStaff:!1},submissionChosen:{id:57,originalPath:"AR/Argentina - Semi finals.osz",anonymisedAs:"Winter",anonymisedPath:"Semi finals/Winter.osz",countryId:49,createdAt:"2020-09-03T02:19:29.576Z",updatedAt:"2020-09-03T04:01:18.000Z",country:{id:49,name:"Argentina",code:"AR",wasConfirmed:!0}}},{id:77,comment:"Overall, I think Winter has more faithful representation of music than Fall.

I also liked the small variation at 00:39:994 - to make the section more linear. Those calm sections with a low SV made the kiai parts using faster sliders even stand out.

Fall makes great use of \"anti-emphasis\" circle patterns (is that what people call these? screw terminology) which, unlike in a lot of ranked maps, work really well with the playful melody and are varied enough throughout the map to not get boring. They also work great as an introduction to awesome climax patterns like 02:47:194 -. I felt like the chorus at 01:05:594 - could have been mapped a bit more intensely, as the spacings mostly stay the same or lower compared to the less intense sections before, even if the higher SV does have an effect. Patterns like 01:13:860 (1,2,1,2,1,2) - would have represented the intensity better if they were using jumps in some way instead of all low spacing.\nWinter has certain sections that stick out a lot. For example, 01:56:794 - follows the song's increase in intensity super well with how the slider velocity and cursor movement, as well as hitsounding are exploding. I also like 02:35:194 - a lot, using 1/16 extended sliders for those vocals is an interesting idea in a calm section that works surprisingly well and makes this section stand out a lot compared to how it was mapped in the other entries. Some other sections of the map, while all high quality, don't really stand out and can feel a bit underwhelming. The choruses have nice ideas, but they aren't executed that convincingly - for example, SV-changes in patterns like 01:19:994 (1,2,3,4,5) - are almost not noticable right now because of how minor they are and how they don't matter for the movement on those sliders at all, while they would be great on showing the change in pitch and intensity of those vocals. Sections like 00:14:394 - are a bit more repetetive than they should be in my opinion, especially since the music is not the same in every measure (00:16:527 - etc having no bell sounds).\nOverall I like both maps a lot with just minor flaws in each one, but I think Fall has a more consistent quality throughout the whole map which is why it's my choice.",judgeId:641,matchId:14,submissionChosenId:59,createdAt:"2020-09-12T13:51:38.757Z",updatedAt:"2020-09-12T13:51:38.757Z",judge:{id:641,osuId:2202645,username:"Myxo",roleId:6,requestAccessId:null,mapperApplicationId:null,captainVoteId:null,createdAt:"2020-06-14T05:27:09.972Z",updatedAt:"2020-06-14T05:27:22.000Z",isBasicUser:!1,isElevatedUser:!1,isRestricted:!1,isContestant:!1,isCaptain:!1,isJudge:!0,isStaff:!1},submissionChosen:{id:59,originalPath:"BR/Brazil - Semi finals.osz",anonymisedAs:"Fall",anonymisedPath:"Semi finals/Fall.osz",countryId:38,createdAt:"2020-09-03T03:51:13.691Z",updatedAt:"2020-09-03T04:08:10.000Z",country:{id:38,name:"Brazil",code:"BR",wasConfirmed:!0}}},{id:74,comment:"Expertise:\nHard one. [Fall] is decent, but [Winter] is more unique but also has its flaws.\n\n[Winter] has a lot more contrast due to different ideas being put together in different sections. But since the song is not that different between sections so it probably need some sort of theme to tie all these sections up together. Otherwise it would look like just a decent map with ideas thrown differently between sections, which is fine but not fantastic.\n\nNot sure what to comment on this for [Fall], there are quite a few cute patterns in the last chorus. Hitsounding is okay-ish. Not using customs is fine but the vocal has been really dominating in this song while hitsounds didn't do much to complement that.\n\n----------------------\nCohesion:\n[Fall] clearly wins on this.\nThe last kiai of [Winter] didn't really wow me that much compared to previous kiais. I get the kiais are not the same counterpart but I expect the last one to be more interesting from the fact that you used kiai on it.\nThe verses are interesting, but not tricky enough to be challenging. I mean this would have been totally playable even in 4* or insane maps. Hence, verses are too easy compared to more important parts.\n\n\n----------------------\nCreativity:\n[Winter] has more stuff going on but was not that well executed as explained in other criteria.\n[Fall] has some cute stuff but none of them are neither fundamental nor making a big enough impact to the entry. And most of them are patterning-based so I didn't feel like there is that much variety overall.\n\n----------------------\nJudge's Impression:\nI am surprised most of the comments are directed towards [Winter] but there is so much (both pros and cons) to write about after looking at it.\n\nThat aside, your quarterfinal entries were much better than what I am seeing from this round.

The spring difficulty was great at times with some great patterns like 01:33:060 (1,2,3,4,1) - but at other times it felt like it was pretty unclear what of the song they wanted to showcase in the chorusses, so there was just a lot of dense rhythm but it didnt really feel like anything was highlighted of the song. This was most apparent for me at 01:18:394 (1) - with sections like 01:21:594 (1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5,1) - .\nOne other thing I wanted to point to is that some parts had weird intensity drops like 03:05:860 (1,1,1) - in the middle of the chorus where the amount of movement is pretty low and you only click every 1/1 gap making it not fit in with the rest of the section.\nOverall the Spring diff is really solid but I would have liked it if it had shown off more of what the song had to offer, I will mention though that the section at 01:56:794 (1) - really stood out with its linear patterns and fit perfectly to show the change in the song.\n\nLike I said earlier i preferred the rhythm in the Summer diff over the Spring diff, cause it felt a lot more like it showcased what the song had to offer with its sliders and the SV changes for the pitch, although it would have been nice if the chorus starts had some more impact as starting it on a slow slider like 01:05:594 (1) - doesnt show the increase in song intensity all that well. Some more attention to slider movement would have also been nice at times for patterns like 01:21:327 (2,1) - where due to sliderend leniency you barely move and so it feels more like a slowdown/awkward to play pattern instead of a peak in the song.\nWhile the rhythm in general is good, it still could be improved at times like 03:14:527 (3,4,5,1) - where it just felt overly dense when the section could have used some calmer rhythm towards the ending of the song.

Particularly how both entries design rest moments into their kiais strikes me as a bit off. Spring has a lot of slider arranges like 01:05:594 (1,2) - 01:07:460 (1,2) - 01:08:527 (3,1) - which break up cursor movement quite a bit by having to pause and move a small distance to the next object. Summer has its own flavor of this with the big SV slowdowns for 01:05:594 (1) - 01:08:794 (1) - etc.\nFor the first half of the chorus, 01:05:594 - to 01:18:394 - , these are mostly fine choices. However when the song's intensity increases in the second half, 01:18:394 - to 01:30:394 - , they really hurt because both entries increase intensity of everything but these patterns. The slowdowns end up feeling very forced and not really suited with how there's otherwise a clear progression. This especially hurts for Spring as their otherwise very straining patterning continuously gets interrupted, leaving not only an inconsistent play experience but also a very inconsistent representation of the song. Spring also takes a final hit in the last chorus, which somehow is the least intense kiai due to things like 03:05:860 (1,1,1) - . \nFor Summer it's not as bad since they're still very isolated instances on very specific moments on the song, the rest does manage to keep up.\n\nExtending from this, generally speaking I'd personally say Summer just has a lot more definition in its map. Spring's calm sections like 00:39:994 - 00:53:327 - and repeats are decently done but are so lacking of strain and interest that they feel like filler sections compared to the main bits of the song. On the otherside, Summer does a decent effort to incorporate them with symmetry ideas and fitting difficulty for the map overall.\nSame thing can be said about transitions, where Spring has things like 00:25:860 (1,2,3,1,2,1,2) - that skips half the transition and then puts some small spaced jumps vs Summer really making sure these 00:25:994 (1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2) - have plenty of contrast. Similarly 01:03:994 (1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1) - on Summer vs 01:03:994 (1,2,3,4,5,6,1,1,2) - on Spring, it's not really about the spacing but the amount the patterns stands out to indicate something new is coming after the build-up.\n\nSo, in the end my preference goes towards Summer's entry, though realistically speaking it's only small things that make a big difference when both entries are this solid.

It seems this part was the most importantly interpreted by mappers, and gave the way how players should be listening the song. Using 2 repeated sliders formed a memorable experience. Other notable attempts were the same appliance of slider shape for a specific sound 05:16:579 (1) - or 01:04:179 (1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2) - for a specific snap. Things unmentioned felt relatively vague to understand with the song, but still I hope the mentioned attempts worked as a navigator for the song.\n\n"Pestilence": I generally like maps that have an intention with the combo color haxing because I think it\'s a powerful tool to convey the mapper intention. The color selections were very effectively showing contrast between a musical shift, but I wasn\'t really sure if the haxing decision had a strong relationship with the actual song/mapping. For example, 00:52:979 - 05:48:979 - these parts were allocated the same color combination while the song was completely different which was also mapped in a different way. They were just showing the difference of the song, instead of clearly showing the structure of the song. \nOne of the interesting attempts I spotted was the sfx at 00:52:179 - 03:24:979 - 04:20:979 - with the "round X" voice. Cool effects and seems that\'s the way how this entry viewed the song, but personally I think it confused in understanding how the song was actually composed because the last two section has a stronger similarity than the first while they felt to be all mapped differently.

Famine takes ideas from plenty of entries throughout this contest and perfects them, it's in a way the ultimate bwc2020 map - clean tech mapping with a progression in patterning and sample-based hitsounding done super well. Pestilence is overflowing with creativity, every section adds something new and the pattern complexity is insane throughout the whole map. Let's focus on the few negatives:\nThe 1/3-based section at 01:44:179 - feels a bit overdone in Pestilence for how the music is relatively calm here. I think the low spacing used in Famine fits way better. The second half of it however 01:57:379 - is extremely well done in Pestilence with the chaotic slider arrangements representing every detail of the synth, which feels a bit underwhelming in Famine in comparison. Famine has patterns that feel slightly underrepresentative of the music, for example some of the sliderstreams like 04:05:379 - where the music is doing a more interesting emphasis than just a 4-4-grouping, and there are lots of similar sliderstreams used throughout the map representing different things. Another example would be 04:16:979 - where both drums and melody are emphasizing blue ticks more so the 1/2-based emphasis feels a bit off.\nI'll go with Pestilence because its mapping complexity is higher due to harder readability, as well as more varied rhythm and patterning, while still feeling coherent and creative throughout and me having less nitpicks with it overall, even with the kind of overdone 1/3-section.",judgeId:641,matchId:16,submissionChosenId:63,createdAt:"2020-10-11T23:26:00.817Z",updatedAt:"2020-10-11T23:26:00.817Z",judge:{id:641,osuId:2202645,username:"Myxo",roleId:6,requestAccessId:null,mapperApplicationId:null,captainVoteId:null,createdAt:"2020-06-14T05:27:09.972Z",updatedAt:"2020-06-14T05:27:22.000Z",isBasicUser:!1,isElevatedUser:!1,isRestricted:!1,isContestant:!1,isCaptain:!1,isJudge:!0,isStaff:!1},submissionChosen:{id:63,originalPath:"GB/United Kingdom - Finals.osz",anonymisedAs:"Pestilence",anonymisedPath:"Finals/Pestilence.osz",countryId:16,createdAt:"2020-10-03T03:01:33.939Z",updatedAt:"2020-10-04T14:22:30.000Z",country:{id:16,name:"United Kingdom",code:"GB",wasConfirmed:!0}}},{id:89,comment:"This one was way closer for me than the other matchup in the finals here but I'll start with Famine.\n\nThis map had some great stuff in it, and I'll start with those as the slow at 02:22:579 (1) - really deserves some highlighting with how it uses the repetition and spikes in density to really effectively convey the slow section while not bumping the density too high. This repetition also returned in a great way in the last chorus 03:28:179 (1) - and in general this part is too me the highlight of the map, as the way these repetition patterns are used make it stand out clearly from the rest of the map and it was able to do that while still keeping the intensity high enough with all of these longer sliders. \nThere were some negatives though, as it felt like some of the patterns didnt match the progression of the song all that well, patterns like 01:04:179 (1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3) - where song goes up in intensity but the map lowers spacing instead. And while I understand that at times this may be a valid way to reflect parts like these, I really feel like upping the amount you have to move would be more beneficial here. Another pattern I would mention but its relatively minor is that you could have done something similar for 02:08:179 (1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3) - like you did for all the others cause it would have fit really well here. \nFurthermore I would avoid things like 04:50:579 (1,2) - where you have those double perfect overlaps as they are really hard to read well and feel more unfair when some almost fully overlapped patterns often accomplish the same thing. \nFinally I wanted to mention 05:55:379 (1) - and how cool these sliders were to keep density low and still showcase the song well.\n\nOnto pestilence, overall this diff is still very solid but at times I had some problems with how the rhythm was handled, as in the more intense spots in the map the density went really high and it kind of felt like some of the cool rhythms that could have been showcased were lost in favor of more dense things. Some examples of this would be 04:27:179 (1,2) - when just before it you had some really cool patterns for the synth 04:26:579 (1,2,1,2) - but then the rhythm goes back to focussing drums instead. There are some exceptions to this though like the sections at 03:53:379 (1) - were the synth is followed more closely and it makes each of the sliders really impactful to play.\nJust like in the other diff the slow section at 02:19:379 - was mapped really nicely spiking in the correct spots and having some cool rhythm gaps at the end to keep you on your toes. \nLast thing I wanted to mention here was how the transitions/spikes in intensity were handled really well in some spots like 01:16:979 (1) - which actually made use of symmetry in a really nice way without sacrificing much of any for it.\n\nIn the end my vote will still go towards  famine as I prefer how it handled the rhythms in the chorus due to their choice to opt for some less dense rhythms in the chorus which really highlighted the synth.

Famine did poorly in this section because how it patterning is not as sophisticated as Pestilence diff, the rhythm choice hse less surprises and it is containing much more \"simple\" geometric patterns and thus it doesn't have enough visual impact as in Pestilence diff in this section\n2) this song's chorus is super long (03:28:179 - 05:10:579 - ), thus the consistency the Famine diff wants to show (the most visible part is the usage patterns with similar concept behind like 03:29:779 (1,2,1,1,2,1) - , but here i am telling that the styles applied in this nearly 2 minute section are similar). generally this should not be a \"problem\" in a contest if there's no significant contrasts, but the Famine diff has experienced multiple styles in that section and the craziest part is that all of them are executed pretty well (i'd say, though, there're still spaces to improve for part 04:32:379 - 04:38:579 - ), and 03:28:179 - 03:53:779 - is probably one of the best part i have ever seen in this contest, nearly perfect execution. so in this part personally i'd choose a part that provides more variety (that is kind of an extreme case because of the unusual length of the chorus part) than a part that is consistent",judgeId:384,matchId:16,submissionChosenId:63,createdAt:"2020-10-10T13:42:37.130Z",updatedAt:"2020-10-10T13:47:30.000Z",judge:{id:384,osuId:7777875,username:"Ryuusei Aika",roleId:6,requestAccessId:null,mapperApplicationId:null,captainVoteId:null,createdAt:"2020-05-03T21:37:18.133Z",updatedAt:"2020-06-14T05:20:14.000Z",isBasicUser:!1,isElevatedUser:!1,isRestricted:!1,isContestant:!1,isCaptain:!1,isJudge:!0,isStaff:!1},submissionChosen:{id:63,originalPath:"GB/United Kingdom - Finals.osz",anonymisedAs:"Pestilence",anonymisedPath:"Finals/Pestilence.osz",countryId:16,createdAt:"2020-10-03T03:01:33.939Z",updatedAt:"2020-10-04T14:22:30.000Z",country:{id:16,name:"United Kingdom",code:"GB",wasConfirmed:!0}}},{id:84,comment:"really tough. really really tough~  to me both maps are literally on the same level, so I didn't vote ''for the best'' because there is simply no best. I voted for the one who had *less* mistakes (which were few in both cases), so let's go straight to the point haha\n\nPestilence blew my mind, period. But while it did an extraordinary job with it's huge complexity, that was also a double-edged knife, because at some sections it was very clear how they lost control of the map. Notable example would be at 05:36:179 - where the song drastically lowers intensity, but Pestilence still has a high density and high pacing on the map, for example 05:36:979 (1,2,3,4,1) - starting the kickslider spam even before new sounds like 05:37:179 - so it's just straight up big overmapping. another example would be very intense patterns like 05:38:779 (2,1,2,3,4,1) -  and 05:39:979 (1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2) - that are just as intense as the rest of the map, but the song is way waaay weaker, when compared to what Famine did, it's very very noticeable the huge difference of control over complexity. \n\nFaminie also had it's mistakes, however, those mistakes were mostly isolated errors. Notable example would be 01:47:512 (1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3) - where the jump for the (1)s is clearly missplaced because the entire section focuses it on the kick sound, but here the pattern has the kick sound on (3) and it's applying jumps on (1), which most likely is a mistake on the patterning that passed unnoticed by the team members. Other smaller examples would be how 03:47:779 (1,2,1) - is actually the same rhythm as 03:47:379 (1,2) - and even the hitsounding hints at that, but the mapped rhythm contradicts both things, so that could mostly be improved with a bit more of communication.\n\nsince I have to pick a winner, that would be Famine, they did have patterning issues in a few places, but they're specific things that could be easily fixed... In Pestilence case, it's mostly an issue of intensity choice through sections and bigger patterns, even if just in a few places, the amount of fix that would need to be applied is a bit higher. So for that reason alone being that Famine was the map with less mistakes and also imo a more pog execution of hype parts like 03:28:179 - with the repeating patterns, for a  very very small amount of ''more positive points'' , it gets my vote.",judgeId:640,matchId:16,submissionChosenId:60,createdAt:"2020-10-08T00:43:11.949Z",updatedAt:"2020-10-11T22:12:26.000Z",judge:{id:640,osuId:2857314,username:"Seto Kousuke",roleId:6,requestAccessId:null,mapperApplicationId:null,captainVoteId:null,createdAt:"2020-06-14T05:22:58.542Z",updatedAt:"2020-06-14T05:23:18.000Z",isBasicUser:!1,isElevatedUser:!1,isRestricted:!1,isContestant:!1,isCaptain:!1,isJudge:!0,isStaff:!1},submissionChosen:{id:60,originalPath:"AR/Argentina - Finals.osz",anonymisedAs:"Famine",anonymisedPath:"Finals/Famine.osz",countryId:49,createdAt:"2020-10-02T09:42:52.025Z",updatedAt:"2020-10-04T14:23:21.000Z",country:{id:49,name:"Argentina",code:"AR",wasConfirmed:!0}}}]},{id:17,information:null,roundId:5,teamAId:38,teamBId:19,createdAt:"2020-05-29T10:50:56.005Z",updatedAt:"2020-09-13T23:36:10.000Z",teamA:{id:38,name:"Brazil",code:"BR",wasConfirmed:!0},teamB:{id:19,name:"Russian Federation",code:"RU",wasConfirmed:!0},submissions:[{id:62,originalPath:"BR/Brazil - Finals.osz",anonymisedAs:"War",anonymisedPath:"Finals/War.osz",countryId:38,createdAt:"2020-10-03T02:35:12.614Z",updatedAt:"2020-10-04T14:24:50.000Z",country:{id:38,name:"Brazil",code:"BR",wasConfirmed:!0}},{id:61,originalPath:"RU/Russian Federation - Finals.osz",anonymisedAs:"Death",anonymisedPath:"Finals/Death.osz",countryId:19,createdAt:"2020-10-03T00:03:39.496Z",updatedAt:"2020-10-04T14:24:12.000Z",country:{id:19,name:"Russian Federation",code:"RU",wasConfirmed:!0}}],eliminationJudging:[{id:94,comment:"Wonderful entry for both, I could truly feel the atmosphere of the finals for o!bwc on everything starting from the song selection, mapping choice, and the creative ideas. Seeming from first impression, it was hard to decide one, but after taking a closer look, \"Death\" was the winner from me. Congratulations.\n\n\"Death\": First of all, I'd like to say the cross sliders of 00:29:123 (1) - and the similar concepted ones fitted the song very effectively with the hitsound selection. That slider itself formed a strong identity to define this map, with innovative movements that regular maps wouldn't provide. They also supported other decisions like 04:28:642 (1) - as a concept. Another thing that I highly valued was its rhythm design. Each section had a distinct rhythm idea supported with the combo color haxing. Since the map was clearly allocating a different rhythm design when it comes to different music, the interpretation from the mapping side was delivered very well. One example I liked was 01:01:440 - the stream here, where the clicks had a distinct movement supported by the unique hitsounds exclusively. \nSomething what I didn't liked was how the calm section 02:28:861 - was handled. It rather felt like a filler section with low rhythm density, because it seemed to lack some representative idea unlike other parts of the map. It could've worked if it was just few seconds, but a whole 1 minute being a filler section didn't felt the best for me.\n\n\"War\": Along the other entry, I could see some fancy shapes on 00:18:323 - these sounds. Especially as the title \"Flugel\" means \"wing\" according to my own research, I'd say it was a cool approach to fit the song's theme. I found there were several sections that created an interesting movement with using SV manipulations like 00:59:622 - 01:37:755 - 02:03:081 - 03:59:017 - . Personally, 00:58:531 - this section was one of my favorites of this entry on how the patterns formed a rotation along the movements. However, the rhythm design in multiple sections didn't felt the most interesting thing for me because some parts like 01:13:355 - were showing too similar rhythming for the whole section. Seems the map was expressing the song with intensity control between the streams and subtle rhythm changing with kick sliders, but as the whole section was similarly rhythmed, the map didn't felt diverse enough. \nAlso while there was an interesting attempt with hitsounding at the kiai section, the mapping after that part was personally a bit disappointing to see. The mapping of kiai was something completely different from the rest of the map to give an emphasis, but the idea didn't felt interesting enough to work as the most highlighted spot. As most sliders were having the same shape/angle, I don't think it delivered some interesting flow or visuals unlike the rest of the map. It gave me an impression whether the entry ran out of time and rushed to complete the map. Things like 04:54:762 (1,2,3,1) - 04:57:962 (1,2,3,4,5) - being an uninspired pattern along the different rhythm from the long sliders at the intro made me feel that way stronger.",judgeId:639,matchId:17,submissionChosenId:61,createdAt:"2020-10-12T00:09:10.900Z",updatedAt:"2020-10-12T01:02:22.000Z",judge:{id:639,osuId:11771,username:"Sonnyc",roleId:6,requestAccessId:null,mapperApplicationId:null,captainVoteId:null,createdAt:"2020-06-14T05:22:48.298Z",updatedAt:"2020-06-14T05:24:24.000Z",isBasicUser:!1,isElevatedUser:!1,isRestricted:!1,isContestant:!1,isCaptain:!1,isJudge:!0,isStaff:!1},submissionChosen:{id:61,originalPath:"RU/Russian Federation - Finals.osz",anonymisedAs:"Death",anonymisedPath:"Finals/Death.osz",countryId:19,createdAt:"2020-10-03T00:03:39.496Z",updatedAt:"2020-10-04T14:24:12.000Z",country:{id:19,name:"Russian Federation",code:"RU",wasConfirmed:!0}}},{id:92,comment:"Really sick to see two entries that are this good, but also so different, at the final stages of the tourney. Bless Cranky too for being absolutely epic as well while I'm at it.\n\nWar\nFollows a trend of using smaller circles that we've seen plenty times before, but gives it its own niche with the many stream shapes and jumps. Makes it a pretty enjoyable and interesting challenge to play. I'm especially liking that it heavily relies on precise movements rather than strong spacing impacts to create emphasis, contrast and patterning ideas. Going from triples like 00:59:076 (3,4,5) - to stream shapes like 01:18:605 (1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,1) - etc, really nice difficulty design overall.\n\nWhat I'm mainly lacking though is .. relevance. I'm seeing a lot of different stream shapes, patterns and spacing changes but I find it difficulty to tie to what's happening in the song. Like this entire sequence 01:25:355 (1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,1) - for example seems to not build on what happened before it all, and just goes for tension, I guess? \nThe violin seems very downplayed, with emphasis switching from being rhythmical (01:13:355 (1) - 01:14:855 (1) - 01:16:355 (1) - 01:17:855 (1) - ) to using direction changes (01:20:855 (1) - 01:22:355 (2) - 01:26:855 (1) - 01:27:511 (8) - ) to not really existing at all (01:32:855 (1) - ). \nSpots where the violin isn't present also seem a bit arbitrary, streams like 01:17:105 (1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4) - 01:29:105 (1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,1) - 01:34:261 (1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4) - seem to just fill in for the sake of intensity without connecting to the song well. Makes it feel like the entire section just becomes \"streams\" with the song being a second factor.\nThere's also things like 04:21:892 - vs 04:24:142 - where the drum transition is mapped essentially the same as the piano before it, rather underwhelming.\n\nAs for the rest of the map, I'm mainly lacking ideas that tie things together. Like even when it comes to the earlier slider-arts it starts with a really epic symmetric idea but then just builds into shapes that feel unrelated 00:31:923 (1) - 00:35:123 (1) - . I'll give some credit for the slow section 02:43:056 - though, with this idea 02:43:056 (1,2) - repeating through.\n\nHitsounding is fairly simple, until 04:27:142 - where it becomes a bit overbearing.\n\nDeath\nSettles for a lot more conventional diffsettings but doesn't hold back on the mapping because of it. I'm especially loving the visual design of the sliders here, 00:15:523 (1) - and everything that builds on it is actually so sick. Sometimes questionable rankability but sick nonetheless.\n\nWhat mainly takes me by surprise is how safe the main sections feel compared to some of the harder patterns. Both 01:13:355 - 04:03:142 - have generally very low spacing and barely use spaced 1/4 aside from a few transition patterns. Adding to that that a lot of slidershapes are cheesable makes the entire thing feel a bit underwhelming and underemphasized. Later sections like 04:27:142 -  do better at that but it seems a terribly long wait when tons of spaced patterns have already happened. Overall there's a clear effort to emphasize certain sounds with slidershapes though, so I'll give credit for that.\\\n\nThis then also goes into the slow sections, which really come across as filler rather than trying to bring out their unique side.\n\nHitsounding is pretty lit, lots of unique and fitting samples to sell the mood.\n\n-----\n\nDeciding which is the better entry here is really difficult, as they're not only individually good and interesting maps in their own right, but also have decent room to be even better. \nDeath, while underwhelming, does a lot better at putting key patterns in key places, has an overarching idea to tie things together and at least emphasizes through visuals; all of these things I lack in War.\nWar just a generally more fitting and interesting design, but lacks a sense of relevance to me, partly due to how it focuses on less dominant layers and doesn't bring out what's in the foreground\nMy final vote here goes to War.

The hitsounding has great attention to detail and adds a lot to the map. Parts like 01:13:355 - are awesome to play, because of how well extensive slider leniency abuse is used. I also love this part 02:06:081 - with its extreme spacing and rhythm contrast. What brought the map down for me a bit was the long calm section from 02:39:282 - to 03:39:268 - which is not mapped in an exciting way, neither gameplay-wise nor visually. Adding on to that, throughout the map there are plenty of patterns that stick out as difficulty spikes or having less quality, some examples: 00:49:151 - to 00:51:463 - is a huge difficulty spike not really justified by the intensity of the music, 03:46:586 (1,1,1,1,1,1,1) - the 1/6 feels like an afterthought and the pattern is pretty messy to read and play with how the spacing is currently, and the final pattern idea 05:23:950 - feels introduced too late to be used with this spacing and density. The sliderart throughout the map looks nice, but some of the long sliders are on the edge of rankability leaning towards unrankable, because the paths are not clear enough. Lastly, a really minor thing but 04:02:579 - perfect geometry like this, that appears sometimes during the map, feels a little out of place stylistically in a map that usually uses more dynamic visuals.\nWar takes less risks than Death and is therefore not as visually impressive, although the sliderart is very nice looking in this map as well. Some patterns used throughout the map feel a little overused, for example 01:49:900 - or continuous blanket patterns like 00:24:723 -, I would have liked to see more variety there. However, the main focus of the map are the streams and those are used with great variety of shapes, making them interesting throughout. I like how the map creates intensity through rhythm and small movement differences rather than using big spacing, which also works very well with the small CS. The hitsounding is very different from Death's hitsounding but also really well done. The calm section in this map is way more engaging than on the other entry, due to its use of extended sliders. The difficulty progression throughout the map is perfectly in line with the song's intensity, and the mapping quality is also consistent throughout.

02:11:506 - since the song has a lot of 1/4 rhythms throughout, playing around with custom hitnormals on these parts would not be a bad idea to create more contrast between these and other sections.\n- 04:51:162 (1) - 05:04:762 (1) - etc ambiguous slidershapes are one thing but they didn't give that much impression to the entry even though you went so far to being borderline with RC.\n- 00:58:531 - 01:13:355 - using reverse sliders on these parts are pretty risky in terms of \"what else could have been done\" and they are not paying off that well.\n- 04:27:142 - 1/1 sliders idea here is pretty cool actually.\n\n[War]\n- 01:13:355 - This part plays fine but I wish there is a clearer cut on what rhythms are being focused on.\n- 01:48:400 (5) - 03:45:461 (1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4) - Hate to nitpick but these don't really look cohesive.\n- Kiai is quite nice but didn't look stand out to me considering other sections are already swamped with intense 1/4s.\n\n[Comparisons]\n- 02:39:282 - Was expecting something a little bit more theme-y from both entries based since vocal + synth (or whatever it is) are pretty strong here.\n- [Death] patterns sometimes suddenly went passive, 01:37:355 - 01:54:627 - 03:51:688 - etc. I tried to respect the interpretation but these things are relying too much on pitches rather than how intense each section should be pictured.\n- [War] clearly wins on sliderart here.\n\nOverall would go with [War] since it tends to be more creative + cleaner when the song gets calm plus all the things mentioned above.",judgeId:108,matchId:17,submissionChosenId:62,createdAt:"2020-10-10T07:32:13.069Z",updatedAt:"2020-10-11T19:59:22.000Z",judge:{id:108,osuId:6485263,username:"Electoz",roleId:6,requestAccessId:null,mapperApplicationId:null,captainVoteId:null,createdAt:"2020-05-02T16:49:45.190Z",updatedAt:"2020-06-14T05:20:58.000Z",isBasicUser:!1,isElevatedUser:!1,isRestricted:!1,isContestant:!1,isCaptain:!1,isJudge:!0,isStaff:!1},submissionChosen:{id:62,originalPath:"BR/Brazil -

The big sliders from War all followed a similar theme and were very well polished while Death's just seemed to be nice but random shapes (and sometimes a bit confusing as well), rhythms on War followed song more coherently while Death's seemed to be trying to create rhythms that the song didn't really did and that ended up just making the contrast almost inexistent like for example the section at 01:13:358 - where it uses several 1/2 rhythms, reverses, etc etc to create rhythms that despite being fun to play and creative, they don't connect with what the song is actually doing too well. Additionally, considering the entire map follow this same trend it's hard to notice a good contrast between different sections because they're mostly trying to overdo things that didn't happen, that makes stronger sections not stand out as much. In War's case the contrast is much more noticeable like the kiai part where gameplay becomes more straight and snappy to aim, increasing the uniqueness of it compared to the rest of the map, and sections seemed to be much more connected with the song's ideas.\n\nboth maps are extraordinary, but War seemed to be made with gameplay experience being taken more into account, the map feels more unique and connected to the song while also keeping difficulty spikes mostly on point, without being too forced compared to Death's.",judgeId:640,matchId:17,submissionChosenId:62,createdAt:"2020-10-07T23:49:16.075Z",updatedAt:"2020-10-11T21:41:57.000Z",judge:{id:640,osuId:2857314,username:"Seto Kousuke",roleId:6,requestAccessId:null,mapperApplicationId:null,captainVoteId:null,createdAt:"2020-06-14T05:22:58.542Z",updatedAt:"2020-06-14T05:23:18.000Z",isBasicUser:!1,isElevatedUser:!1,isRestricted:!1,isContestant:!1,isCaptain:!1,isJudge:!0,isStaff:!1},submissionChosen:{id:62,originalPath:"BR/Brazil - Finals.osz",anonymisedAs:"War",anonymisedPath:"Finals/War.osz",countryId:38,createdAt:"2020-10-03T02:35:12.614Z",updatedAt:"2020-10-04T14:24:50.000Z",country:{id:38,name:"Brazil",code:"BR",wasConfirmed:!0}}}]}]}],T=function(e,t,i,s){var a,n=arguments.length,o=n<3?t:null===s?s=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(t,i):s;if("object"==typeof Reflect&&"function"==typeof Reflect.decorate)o=Reflect.decorate(e,t,i,s);else for(var r=e.length-1;r>=0;r--)(a=e[r])&&(o=(n<3?a(o):n>3?a(t,i,o):a(t,i))||o);return n>3&&o&&Object.defineProperty(t,i,o),o},S=function(e,t){if("object"==typeof Reflect&&"function"==typeof Reflect.metadata)return Reflect.metadata(e,t)};let C=class extends n.a{constructor(){super(...arguments),this.selectedMatch=null}created(){this.eliminationRounds.length&&this.currentRound||this.$store.commit("updateEliminations",{rounds:k,currentRound:null})}getRoundClass(e){return this.currentRound?e==this.currentRound.id?"round--current":"":"round--current"}};T([A.b,S("design:type",Array)],C.prototype,"eliminationRounds",void 0),T([A.b,S("design:type",Object)],C.prototype,"currentRound",void 0),T([A.a,S("design:type",Array)],C.prototype,"nonFinals",void 0),T([A.a,S("design:type",Object)],C.prototype,"finals",void 0),C=T([Object(o.b)({components:{PageHeader:r.a,RoundMatch:p,EliminationJudgingDetail:I,TimeString:v.a}})],C);var x=C,q=Object(u.a)(x,s,[],!1,null,null,null);q.options.__file="src/views/results/EliminationResult.vue";t.default=q.exports}}]);
